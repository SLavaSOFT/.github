# Contributing to Cimro 2.0

We welcome contributions from the community to help us improve Cimro 2.0. Whether you're a developer, designer, tester, or simply a user with a great idea, your contributions are valuable.

## How to Contribute

Here's a general guide on how to contribute to Cimro 2.0:

1.  **Fork the Repository:**  Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the Cimro 2.0 repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2.  **Clone Your Fork:**  Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `REPOSITORY_NAME` with the name of your forked repository (likely "Cimro-2.0").

3.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes.  Choose a descriptive name for your branch, reflecting the issue you're addressing or the feature you're adding.  For example:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix-typo-in-documentation
    git checkout -b add-new-feature-x
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes:**  Make your desired changes to the code, documentation, or any other relevant files.

5.  **Commit Your Changes:**  Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.  Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

    *   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
    *   Use the imperative mood ("Fix bug" not "Fixes bug").
    *   The first line should be a short (50 characters or less) summary of the change.
    *   Separate the summary from the body with a blank line.
    *   Use the body to provide more detailed explanations if necessary.

    Example:

    ```
    Fix: Corrected typo in installation guide

    The previous version of the installation guide had a typo
    in the section describing how to configure the database.  This
    commit corrects the typo and ensures accurate instructions.
    ```

    ```bash
    git add .  # Or add specific files
    git commit -m "Fix: Corrected typo in installation guide"
    ```

6.  **Push Your Changes:** Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin fix-typo-in-documentation
    ```

7.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Go to your forked repository on GitHub.  You should see a banner prompting you to create a pull request for your newly pushed branch.  Click the "Compare & pull request" button.

8.  **Fill Out the Pull Request Details:**

    *   **Title:**  Give your pull request a clear and descriptive title that summarizes your changes.
    *   **Description:** Provide a detailed explanation of the changes you've made, the problem you're addressing, and the solution you've implemented.  Include any relevant context or background information.  Reference any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
    *   **Checklist:** Consider including a checklist of items to ensure your contribution is complete (e.g., "Code is tested," "Documentation is updated," "Code style is consistent").

9.  **Submit Your Pull Request:** Click the "Create pull request" button.

10. **Review and Discussion:**  The project maintainers will review your pull request.  They may ask you to make changes or provide clarifications.  Be responsive to feedback and willing to collaborate to improve your contribution.

11. **Merging:**  Once your pull request is approved, the maintainers will merge it into the main branch of the Cimro 2.0 repository.
